The upside is that the hobby brought out the 'mechanic' in him and that has been amazing to watch.Regular maintenance after every few hours of run time includes break-down\t clean and refill of the shocks\t and he has tested many different weight shock oils and different strength springs over the years. He is tough on these cars and has built several jumps\t so he need the shocks\t shock coils and shock oil to really stand up to the punishment. For the last year or so\t Losi shock oils have become his favorite as their oils just seems to stand up well for a longer period of time.Depending on weather conditions and the type of running he is planning to do (off-road\t pavement speed runs\t dirt track racing...)\t our son will use different weight shock oils in the car... but his most frequently used oils are 40\t 45 and 50 weight. Since he cleans the shock regularly\t we typically purchase the larger 4 ounce bottles instead of smaller ones.If you are looking for a good remote control car or truck shock oil\t for uses as I have described above\t then our son totally recommends that you give Losi Shock Oil a try based on his experience with it. Highly recommended\t especially in these more economically priced larger bottles.Go for it\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"TTM-Funktionsmodellbau\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£7.64\"\"}\n on 24 Feb. 2015 // good\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£8.93\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Amazon.co.uk\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£8.95\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"trainmad\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£7.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"MEGA-MAG\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£28.63\"\"}]}\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 11 April 2015 // He loved it\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£12.93\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Amazon.co.uk\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£12.95\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"Modelsales\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£13.50\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"BuySend\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£15.79\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"MEGA-MAG\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£37.69\"\"}]}\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 21 Jan. 2016 // top toy\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£12.94\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"GiftLocalUK\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£12.96\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"Sell 24x7\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£13.07\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"Fun Fuzion\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£10.38\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"Life Unearthed\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£14.31\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_6\"\"=>\"\"Venture Blue\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_6\"\"=>\"\"£14.47\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_7\"\"=>\"\"Mini Model Shop\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_7\"\"=>\"\"£12.76\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_8\"\"=>\"\"Amazon.co.uk\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_8\"\"=>\"\"£16.31\"\"}\n on 1 Mar. 2015 // well pleased with item and service many thanks\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£12.62\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"UKBulksales\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£12.62\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"Hair Skin Beauty\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£12.64\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"jadlamracingmodels\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£12.72\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"Buy-For-Less-Online\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£12.77\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_6\"\"=>\"\"GamesQuest\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_6\"\"=>\"\"£13.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_7\"\"=>\"\"Model Kits Direct\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_7\"\"=>\"\"£11.76\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_8\"\"=>\"\"DVDCineShop\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_8\"\"=>\"\"£10.34\"\"}\n on 1 Jan. 2015 // Very good had to return due to ordering wrong scale\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£6.93\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Amazon.co.uk\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£6.95\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"MEGA-MAG\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£24.11\"\"}]}\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 17 Sept. 2014 // verygood\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£52.97\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Frome Models Centre\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£52.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"tablet_books\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£85.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"MEGA-MAG\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£114.59\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"japazon\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£123.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_6\"\"=>\"\"Sam Store US\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_6\"\"=>\"\"£300.25\"\"}]}\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 23 Sept. 2014 // have not finished the decals and colors yet but it is good\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£10.48\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Hair Skin Beauty\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£10.50\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"jadlamracingmodels\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£10.56\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"Buy-For-Less-Online\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£11.22\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"GamesQuest\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£10.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_6\"\"=>\"\"UKBulksales\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_6\"\"=>\"\"£13.39\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_7\"\"=>\"\"Model Kits Direct\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_7\"\"=>\"\"£9.14\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_8\"\"=>\"\"McKeeman Models\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_8\"\"=>\"\"£10.99\"\"}\n on 4 Oct. 2014 // Dispatched quickly and just as advertised…a brand new model kit in a sealed box.

The upside is that the hobby brought out the 'mechanic' in him and that has been amazing to watch.Regular maintenance after every few hours of run time includes break-down\t clean and refill of the shocks\t and he has tested many different weight shock oils and different strength springs over the years. He is tough on these cars and has built several jumps\t so he need the shocks\t shock coils and shock oil to really stand up to the punishment. For the last year or so\t Losi shock oils have become his favorite as their oils just seems to stand up well for a longer period of time.Depending on weather conditions and the type of running he is planning to do (off-road\t pavement speed runs\t dirt track racing...)\t our son will use different weight shock oils in the car... but his most frequently used oils are 40\t 45 and 50 weight. Since he cleans the shock regularly\t we typically purchase the larger 4 ounce bottles instead of smaller ones.If you are looking for a good remote control car or truck shock oil\t for uses as I have described above\t then our son totally recommends that you give Losi Shock Oil a try based on his experience with it. Highly recommended\t especially in these more economically priced larger bottles.Go for it\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"TTM-Funktionsmodellbau\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£7.64\"\"}\n on 24 Feb. 2015 // good\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£8.93\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Amazon.co.uk\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£8.95\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"trainmad\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£7.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"MEGA-MAG\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£28.63\"\"}]}\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 11 April 2015 // He loved it\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£12.93\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Amazon.co.uk\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£12.95\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"Modelsales\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£13.50\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"BuySend\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£15.79\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"MEGA-MAG\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£37.69\"\"}]}\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 21 Jan. 2016 // top toy\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£12.94\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"GiftLocalUK\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£12.96\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"Sell 24x7\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£13.07\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"Fun Fuzion\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£10.38\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"Life Unearthed\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£14.31\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_6\"\"=>\"\"Venture Blue\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_6\"\"=>\"\"£14.47\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_7\"\"=>\"\"Mini Model Shop\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_7\"\"=>\"\"£12.76\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_8\"\"=>\"\"Amazon.co.uk\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_8\"\"=>\"\"£16.31\"\"}\n on 1 Mar. 2015 // well pleased with item and service many thanks\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£12.62\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"UKBulksales\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£12.62\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"Hair Skin Beauty\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£12.64\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"jadlamracingmodels\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£12.72\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"Buy-For-Less-Online\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£12.77\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_6\"\"=>\"\"GamesQuest\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_6\"\"=>\"\"£13.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_7\"\"=>\"\"Model Kits Direct\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_7\"\"=>\"\"£11.76\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_8\"\"=>\"\"DVDCineShop\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_8\"\"=>\"\"£10.34\"\"}\n on 1 Jan. 2015 // Very good had to return due to ordering wrong scale\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£6.93\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Amazon.co.uk\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£6.95\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"MEGA-MAG\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£24.11\"\"}]}\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 17 Sept. 2014 // verygood\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£52.97\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Frome Models Centre\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£52.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"tablet_books\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£85.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"MEGA-MAG\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£114.59\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"japazon\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£123.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_6\"\"=>\"\"Sam Store US\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_6\"\"=>\"\"£300.25\"\"}]}\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 23 Sept. 2014 // have not finished the decals and colors yet but it is good\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£10.48\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Hair Skin Beauty\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£10.50\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"jadlamracingmodels\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£10.56\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"Buy-For-Less-Online\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£11.22\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"GamesQuest\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£10.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_6\"\"=>\"\"UKBulksales\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_6\"\"=>\"\"£13.39\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_7\"\"=>\"\"Model Kits Direct\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_7\"\"=>\"\"£9.14\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_8\"\"=>\"\"McKeeman Models\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_8\"\"=>\"\"£10.99\"\"}\n on 4 Oct. 2014 // Dispatched quickly and just as advertised…a brand new model kit in a sealed box.

The upside is that the hobby brought out the 'mechanic' in him and that has been amazing to watch.Regular maintenance after every few hours of run time includes break-down\t clean and refill of the shocks\t and he has tested many different weight shock oils and different strength springs over the years. He is tough on these cars and has built several jumps\t so he need the shocks\t shock coils and shock oil to really stand up to the punishment. For the last year or so\t Losi shock oils have become his favorite as their oils just seems to stand up well for a longer period of time.Depending on weather conditions and the type of running he is planning to do (off-road\t pavement speed runs\t dirt track racing...)\t our son will use different weight shock oils in the car... but his most frequently used oils are 40\t 45 and 50 weight. Since he cleans the shock regularly\t we typically purchase the larger 4 ounce bottles instead of smaller ones.If you are looking for a good remote control car or truck shock oil\t for uses as I have described above\t then our son totally recommends that you give Losi Shock Oil a try based on his experience with it. Highly recommended\t especially in these more economically priced larger bottles.Go for it\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"TTM-Funktionsmodellbau\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£7.64\"\"}\n on 24 Feb. 2015 // good\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£8.93\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Amazon.co.uk\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£8.95\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"trainmad\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£7.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"MEGA-MAG\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£28.63\"\"}]}\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 11 April 2015 // He loved it\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£12.93\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Amazon.co.uk\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£12.95\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"Modelsales\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£13.50\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"BuySend\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£15.79\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"MEGA-MAG\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£37.69\"\"}]}\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 21 Jan. 2016 // top toy\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£12.94\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"GiftLocalUK\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£12.96\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"Sell 24x7\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£13.07\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"Fun Fuzion\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£10.38\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"Life Unearthed\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£14.31\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_6\"\"=>\"\"Venture Blue\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_6\"\"=>\"\"£14.47\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_7\"\"=>\"\"Mini Model Shop\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_7\"\"=>\"\"£12.76\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_8\"\"=>\"\"Amazon.co.uk\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_8\"\"=>\"\"£16.31\"\"}\n on 1 Mar. 2015 // well pleased with item and service many thanks\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£12.62\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"UKBulksales\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£12.62\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"Hair Skin Beauty\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£12.64\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"jadlamracingmodels\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£12.72\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"Buy-For-Less-Online\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£12.77\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_6\"\"=>\"\"GamesQuest\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_6\"\"=>\"\"£13.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_7\"\"=>\"\"Model Kits Direct\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_7\"\"=>\"\"£11.76\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_8\"\"=>\"\"DVDCineShop\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_8\"\"=>\"\"£10.34\"\"}\n on 1 Jan. 2015 // Very good had to return due to ordering wrong scale\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£6.93\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Amazon.co.uk\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£6.95\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"MEGA-MAG\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£24.11\"\"}]}\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 17 Sept. 2014 // verygood\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£52.97\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Frome Models Centre\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£52.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"tablet_books\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£85.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"MEGA-MAG\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£114.59\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"japazon\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£123.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_6\"\"=>\"\"Sam Store US\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_6\"\"=>\"\"£300.25\"\"}]}\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 23 Sept. 2014 // have not finished the decals and colors yet but it is good\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£10.48\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Hair Skin Beauty\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£10.50\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"jadlamracingmodels\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£10.56\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"Buy-For-Less-Online\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£11.22\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"GamesQuest\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£10.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_6\"\"=>\"\"UKBulksales\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_6\"\"=>\"\"£13.39\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_7\"\"=>\"\"Model Kits Direct\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_7\"\"=>\"\"£9.14\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_8\"\"=>\"\"McKeeman Models\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_8\"\"=>\"\"£10.99\"\"}\n on 4 Oct. 2014 // Dispatched quickly and just as advertised…a brand new model kit in a sealed box.

Originally numbered 4498, Sir Nigel Gresley was due to receive the name Bittern, before the realisation of its commemorative status. As with the earlier LNER A4 Pacifics, it was built with a single chimney and side valances covering the wheels which were later removed to improve maintenance access. Sir Nigel Gresley carries a commemorative plaque as the holder of the post-war steam speed record reaching 112mph in May 1959. As with the Mallard’s record this was achieved descending southward from Stoke Summit, but unlike the Mallard’s special attempt this was with a full train of passengers returning from an excursion. As with other A4s, Sir Nigel Gresley has worn many liveries throughout its career. When released to traffic in October 1937 it carried the standard LNER garter blue of the A4 Pacifics and has since carried various liveries. Sir Nigel Gresley, now bearing the British Railways number 60007 with a British Railways blue livery, was saved from scrapping in 1966 by a small group of men who set up the ‘A4 Preservation Society’, later known as ‘The A4 Locomotive Society Ltd’ and now ‘The Sir Nigel Gresley Locomotive Preservation Trust Ltd’. ‘The A4 Locomotive Society’ has since become the subsidiary company that operates the locomotive for the Trust. The Trust is committed to keeping the locomotive operating and running special excursions on both the main line and heritage railways such as the North Yorkshire Moors Railway where it is based.This is an accurate, detailed scale model in die cast presented in a perspex display case mounted on a plinth.

Set Up Each player takes either the red or black set of sixteen dice and prepares to set up at opposite ends of the board. Players then simultaneously roll each of their sixteen dice, one at a time. Once rolled, each die is placed immediately on the board. This commences of the left square on a player’s back row and continues across to the right. On completion of the back row, the dice are placed from the left again on the next row up. After each roll, each die must be placed onto the next available square. Players cannot select on which square they would like to place each die. Once both players have completed the set up, play commences. Rules The player with the most sixes starts (if the players have the same amount, then the player with the most fives starts and so on). Players take one turn each alternately. A player can move any one die the number of squares that corresponds to the number showing on that die. For example, if that number is a 3, the player can move that die forwards, backwards, sideways or diagonally up or down in a straight line over three squares. Within the movement the die cannot pass over any other die (either an opponent’s die or their own). If any move results in a die landing on a square occupied by an opponent’s die then the opponent’s die is ‘taken’ and removed from the board. Instead of moving a die on any turn a player can opt to rotate one of their dice 90 degrees. For example a die with a 3 showing can be turned over to a 1,2,5 or 6 whilst remaining on its current square. This movement constitutes a player’s turn. Winning the Game The first player to get one of their dice onto any square along their opponent’s back row, which their opponent cannot then take on their very next turn, wins the game.

Open the light-up cockpit and fit up to four figures inside. Known as the fastest ship in the Star Wars galaxy, the vehicles comes with Han Solo and Chewbacca figures and can hold up to 16 more (each sold separately) inside its secret smuggling compartments, pivoting gunner station or missile-firing mini-fighter vehicle. Remove the outer panels to access the ship's interior. Then, head for the medical bay to treat wounded troops! Activate deployment sounds and landing lights with the auto-opening boarding ramp. Or plan your attack against the Empire with a pivoting gunner station, rotating laser turret and 3-missile launcher, with plenty of realistic blasting sounds and projectiles to keep enemies at bay. A pivoting training probe makes lightsaber and movement sounds for those who wish to practice their Force fighting skills. Trigger more than 20 authentic movie phrases and sounds from the voices of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C-3PO, Chewbacca and R2-D2! Light up the hyperdrive engine lights and fly your imagination into the next constellation or the other end of your playroom!

However, either can be used if room inside the car body permits. Most Scalextric cars, from 1957 to current date, can be converted to digital operation.

The brilliant new Parrot Bebop Drone 2 additionally incorporates a new 2700mAh battery, cleverly built into the streamlined body, that provides a continuous flight time of up to 25 minutes, more than doubling the previous duration.The new Parrot Bebop 2 weighs a little more than it's predecessor at around 500 grams, but is still remarkably lightweight for a leisure Drone with a professional specification. Capable of improved performance, incorporating four powerful brushless motors fitted with slightly larger propellers to provide additional thrust, the Bebop 2 can climb vertically upwards at 13 mph and fly forward faster at up to 37 mph, allowing the Drone to cope with headwinds better.Controlled using a Smartphone or Tablet with a Wi-Fi range of 300 metres, the Bebop Drone 2 can also be piloted using the exclusive new black Parrot Special Edition Skycontroller, if you prefer. Providing a more precise response by using its two conventional control sticks, the piloting device is fixed on a shelf that will accommodate the vast majority of Smartphones and Tablets available on the market. The Skycontroller can operate the Bebop 2 with or without a Tablet, and extends the Wi-Fi range up to 2 kilometres (1.2 miles), subject to local regulations.Furthermore, for extreme sensations you can connect a virtual reality headset to your Skycontroller, provided it's HDMI compatible, to give you a 'First Person View' from the Drone’s camera, as seen from the cockpit. The pilot can still use the Skycontroller to adjust the position of the camera, independent from the Drones movements. The combination of numerous sensors provides impressive stability, plus great manoeuvrability when flown with the Skycontroller, a Smartphone or Tablet.Designed with safety in mind, the Parrot Bebop Drone 2's lightweight reinforced structure makes it robust and safe. In case of accidental contact, all four propellers stop automatically, additionally an Emergency Mode enables you to land the drone immediately, whilst a GPS Return Home function brings the Drone back to its take off point easily. Always connected, the Parrot Bebop Drone 2 photo and video stream is synchronised in real time on your Smartphone or Tablet, so share your best shots instantly on your favourite social networks, like YouTube and Facebook.Download a free piloting application FreeFlight 3 for controlling the Bebop Drone 2, that is suitable for both iOS and Android Smartphones and Tablets. The application has been specially developed to offer ease of use, and let the pilot focus on the pleasure of flying. On the Welcome Screen, the pilot can easily access the following functions: Piloting, Photos/Videos, Flight Plan and the Pilot Academy. Simply complete the user settings for Altitude, Speed, Piloting Mode, Accelerometer and Virtual Joystick. The FreeFlight app also includes fun features such as a One Touch Flip!Plan your flights on your Smartphone or Tablet by touching waypoints on your screen, and let the Drone do the rest. In addition to increasing the stability in high altitude, the GPS facility allows autonomous flights, and the Drone automatically returns to the take off position. Replay your flights modelled in 3D on the Pilot Academy Map, together with the altitude and speed, plus all the recorded data. Choose your favourite Parrot Bebop Drone 2 from red or white colour schemes, together with the optional black Skycontroller.WARRANTY: A 12 month Parrot warranty provides cover for defective parts and workmanship, subject to proof of purchase, but clearly does not include damage in use. A full range of spare parts are available separately, but always purchase genuine Parrot replacement parts, as the substitution of alternative batteries or spares will invalidate the manufacturers warranty.

Originally numbered 4498, Sir Nigel Gresley was due to receive the name Bittern, before the realisation of its commemorative status. As with the earlier LNER A4 Pacifics, it was built with a single chimney and side valances covering the wheels which were later removed to improve maintenance access. Sir Nigel Gresley carries a commemorative plaque as the holder of the post-war steam speed record reaching 112mph in May 1959. As with the Mallard’s record this was achieved descending southward from Stoke Summit, but unlike the Mallard’s special attempt this was with a full train of passengers returning from an excursion. As with other A4s, Sir Nigel Gresley has worn many liveries throughout its career. When released to traffic in October 1937 it carried the standard LNER garter blue of the A4 Pacifics and has since carried various liveries. Sir Nigel Gresley, now bearing the British Railways number 60007 with a British Railways blue livery, was saved from scrapping in 1966 by a small group of men who set up the ‘A4 Preservation Society’, later known as ‘The A4 Locomotive Society Ltd’ and now ‘The Sir Nigel Gresley Locomotive Preservation Trust Ltd’. ‘The A4 Locomotive Society’ has since become the subsidiary company that operates the locomotive for the Trust. The Trust is committed to keeping the locomotive operating and running special excursions on both the main line and heritage railways such as the North Yorkshire Moors Railway where it is based.This is an accurate, detailed scale model in die cast presented in a perspex display case mounted on a plinth.

I have used most of the track to integrate it with my existing train set\t and will extend it later when I buy some more points. That way I don't have any room for Track Packs E and F.The detail to the engine and the tender are very good and when it runs you can see the connecting rods moving. The three coaches are of good detail\t you can see into the windows\t each coach has 1st and 3rd class compartments (2nd class disappeard sometime ago) and both the corridor and seats are clearly visible.Putting the train on the track took a little time and care is needed when coupling it to the coal tender and the rest of the train.I found that the Flying Scotsman does require a very flat surface to run one\t and time needs to be spent getting all the creases out the base mat.As this train set is at a cost\t I would not let young children play with it on their own\t but under adult supervision they should be able to enjoy this train set.Read more › | Mostly a great set; but not a toy; and ruined by one fundamental design flaw // 1.0 // 24 Nov. 2013 // By\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n020dc0cfda0bd839eb4a42b99062c726\tTY 36148 - OSCAR - EULE MIT GL\tBeanie Boos\t£5.99\t43 new\t9\t1\t4.7 out of 5 stars\tnull\thttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Beanie-Boo-Buddy-Plush-Bubbly/dp/B00G3J725I | http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beanie-Boo-Key-Clip-Oscar/dp/B00S8IB0L4 | http://www.amazon.co.uk/UK-6-inch-Pinky-Beanie-Boo/dp/B00CM6Y1Z0 | http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ty-Spells-Beanie-Boo-6/dp/B008K7RM8I | http://www.amazon.co.uk/TY-Beanie-Boo-Plush-Kacey/dp/B00S4RM4ZU | http://www.amazon.co.uk/TY-BEANIE-BOOS-GLUBSCHI-OWLIVE/dp/B00L392QKE\tOfficial Ty product with the authentic Ty heart-shaped tag!

The game plays quite quick once you get going\t although there are some major flaws in the game which can ruin it (wizzkids have released new rules with latest expansion to sort the problems) Basically if you get any dragon card and cull your low powered dice as quick as possible\t your gonna win..  not maybe you'll win.. you will win.

Set Up Each player takes either the red or black set of sixteen dice and prepares to set up at opposite ends of the board. Players then simultaneously roll each of their sixteen dice, one at a time. Once rolled, each die is placed immediately on the board. This commences of the left square on a player’s back row and continues across to the right. On completion of the back row, the dice are placed from the left again on the next row up. After each roll, each die must be placed onto the next available square. Players cannot select on which square they would like to place each die. Once both players have completed the set up, play commences. Rules The player with the most sixes starts (if the players have the same amount, then the player with the most fives starts and so on). Players take one turn each alternately. A player can move any one die the number of squares that corresponds to the number showing on that die. For example, if that number is a 3, the player can move that die forwards, backwards, sideways or diagonally up or down in a straight line over three squares. Within the movement the die cannot pass over any other die (either an opponent’s die or their own). If any move results in a die landing on a square occupied by an opponent’s die then the opponent’s die is ‘taken’ and removed from the board. Instead of moving a die on any turn a player can opt to rotate one of their dice 90 degrees. For example a die with a 3 showing can be turned over to a 1,2,5 or 6 whilst remaining on its current square. This movement constitutes a player’s turn. Winning the Game The first player to get one of their dice onto any square along their opponent’s back row, which their opponent cannot then take on their very next turn, wins the game.

Series 2\tbattle damaged. Alien Vs Predator 2 Pack closed mouth and this years SDCC Gort Predator)but this version is by far my favourite.The paint job is the best yet\t cleaner\t less sloppiness and more screen accurate colours.It also has a great head sculpt with the mask on\t and the bone trophy's it wears makes it look even more different that previous versions\t and are screen accurate based on the first film. It also includes retractable wrist blade and shoulder mounted cannon.If you don't own any Predator figures\t I would almost definitely go for this version - it is my favourite Predator figure ever! | Better than looks!! // 5.0 // 19 Oct. 2011 // By\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 27 July 2009 // I already owned a few Alternators\t and didn't think you would ever find a better Transformer. I bought Arcee on my wife's request\tas she found it mean that Shockwave and Dead End were ganging up on Silverstreak. I am so glad that I did! In car mode\t Arcee looks like a fantastic model of an Honda S2000\tand converts to a pink and white Autobot female. Mostly in heavyweight diecast metal\twhich looks and feels so much better than her Alternator equivalents. The attention to detail is fantastic-she has a removable hardtop\twhich can be replaced with a piece of plastic which makes her actually look like a convertible! A brilliant touch\talong with the usual Binaltech/Alternator features\tsuch as opening bonnet\tdoors and boot.Even the steering works properly...I'm not normally one for buying Autobots\tbut this one stands proud in my collection\tand I'd recommend her to anyone.\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\nd2bfe4cf310d05f41f2d2b7b7d16c6b5\tOfficial Rainbow Loom 2.0 Starter Kit & Rainbow Loom Monster Tail Travel Kit\tRainbow Loom\t£13.57\t3 new\t9\t1\t5.0 out of 5 stars\tArts & Crafts > Children's Craft Kits > Bead Art & Jewellery-Making\thttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Official-Rainbow-Loom-Fuschia-Refill/dp/B00CGILAXK | http://www.amazon.co.uk/Official-Rainbow-Loom-Jelly-Refill/dp/B00FJQ8JLM | http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rainbow-Loom-Official-Rubber-C-clips/dp/B00J5E2WDA | http://www.amazon.co.uk/Loom-Bandz-Rainbow-Colours-White/dp/B00EU7ECXA | http://www.amazon.co.uk/Official-Rainbow-Loom-Black-Refill/dp/B00H2ZQWC6 | http://www.amazon.co.uk/Official-Rainbow-Loom-Rubber-Includes/dp/B00I8RJMRE\tRainbow Loom Starter Kit with Rainbow Loom Monster Tail Travel Kit\tTechnical Details Product Dimensions30 x 25 x 20 cm Manufacturer recommended age:8 years and up Manufacturer referenceUSI-SAI-F17862    Additional Information ASINB00JFD7TIO Best Sellers Rank 135,964 in Toys & Games (See top 100) #2240 in Toys & Games > Arts & Crafts > Children's Craft Kits > Bead Art & Jewellery-Making Shipping Weight118 g Delivery Destinations:Visit the Delivery Destinations Help page to see where this item can be delivered.
